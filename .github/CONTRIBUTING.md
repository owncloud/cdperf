## Contributing to Source Code

Thanks for wanting to contribute source code to ownCloud. That's great!

Before we're able to merge your code into the ownCloud core, you need to sign our [Contributor Agreement][agreement]. You can sign it digitally as soon as you open your first pull request.

Please read the [Developer Manuals][devmanual] to learn how to create your first application or how to test the ownCloud code with PHPUnit.

In order to constantly increase the quality of our software we can no longer accept pull request which submit un-tested code.
It is a must have that changed and added code segments are unit tested.
In some areas unit testing is hard (aka almost impossible) as of today - in these areas refactoring WHILE fixing a bug is encouraged to enable unit testing.
